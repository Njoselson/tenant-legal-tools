Dear {landlord_name},

RE: Formal Demand for Repairs at {property_address}

I am writing to formally request repairs for the following issues at my rental unit located at {property_address}:

{repair_issues}

These conditions violate {jurisdiction} housing codes and my rights as a tenant under the warranty of habitability. Specifically:

{legal_citations}

I previously notified you of these issues on {previous_notification_date}. As of today, these problems remain unresolved.

Under {jurisdiction} law, landlords are required to maintain rental properties in habitable condition and make necessary repairs within a reasonable timeframe. I request that you address these issues within {deadline} days of receiving this letter.

If these repairs are not completed by {deadline_date}, I will be forced to:

1. File a complaint with {housing_authority}
2. Exercise my rights under {jurisdiction} law, which may include:
   - Withholding rent
   - Repairing and deducting costs from rent
   - Seeking legal remedies through housing court

Please respond within {response_deadline} days to confirm when these repairs will be made. I can be reached at {tenant_phone} or {tenant_email}.

I hope we can resolve this matter promptly and professionally.

Sincerely,

{tenant_name}
