FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY
This summary non-payment proceeding was commenced on April 17 ,2019, against
respondents Juan Garcia and Pilar Guevara in connection with the premises located at 756
Liberty Avenue, Apt. I R, Brooklyn, New York I 1208, (the "subject premises"). In the petition,
756 Libefiy Realty LLC (the "petitioner") alleges $45,900.00 in unpaid rent for the period
February 2017 through April 2019, at a monthly rate of$1,700. Paragraph six of the petition also
alleges "[t]he premises are not subject to the Rent Stabilization Code by virtue of high rent
vacancy decontrol." (see NYSCEF doc # 10). Petitioner claims the subject apartment was
lawfully deregulated in 2008. Petitioner insists it availed itself of lawfully permitted guideline
increases, vacancy increases, and improvements totaling less than $200. For an increase of$200

to the legal regulated rent, petitioner needed to show $8,000 in actual improvements made to the
apartment (l/40 of $8,000 is $200).
Respondents interposed a verified answer which includes, inter alia, a defense alleging
the apartment remains subject to rent stabilization, as well as a counterclaim for overcharge.
Following extensive motion practice, respondents were granted discovery on October 10,
2023 (see NYSCEF doc # 27). Respondents sought documents relevant to the actual or planned
"renovation or construction work beyond ordinary maintenance or repair" as part oftheir
discovery requests. (see NYSCEF doc # 12). The initial discovery demands were made in 2019,
after the case had been freshly filed. Petitioner's December 5,2024, written response to the
demand for documents relevant to the individual apartment improvements states "[n]o
documents responsive to this demand still exist notwithstanding there was an findividual
Apartment Increasel ("IAI") for $200.00 in 2005. Other than the IAI, the rent increases were
because ofvacancy leases". (see NYSCEF doc #36).
The Court began the trial of this proceeding on March 10,2025, and petitioner completed
its prima facie case on May 9,2025. Respondent's counsel moved for a directed verdict based on
the failure ofpetitioner to state a cause ofaction. The Court initially denied the oral motion.
However, after cross-examination ofpetitioner's witness and during respondent's counsel's
direct examination of the same witness, this Court elected to revisit the motion to dismiss and
allow counsel to submit briefs related thereto.
Petitioner called Deodat Lowton, sole member/owner of petitioner, to testiry. During his
testimony, he admitted into evidence a copy ofan Indenture dated November 30,2016, a copy of
the DHPD registration, a copy ofa residential lease dated December 1, 2014, between petitioner
and respondents, which reflected a monthly rent of$1700. The witness also admitted into

evidence collectively copies ofDHCR registrations which reflect prior tenancies, and the period
petitioner deemed the subject premises exempt from rent regulation. Finally, the witness
admitted into evidence a rent leger reflecting $137,700 owed through March of 2025. Mr.
Lowton testified that respondents stopped paying rent in 2016.
The witness also admitted into evidence a copy ofa lease between 760 Liberty Realty
Corp. and Petro Mora dated 411104, reflecting a monthly rent of$1,118/month, beginning 4/l/04
and ending 3/31/05; a copy ofa lease between 760 Liberty Realty Corp. and Anthony Perez
dated 3/l/05 reflecting a monthly rent of$1508.06, beginning 3/l/05 and ending 2/28/06; a copy
of a lease between 760 Liberty Realty Corp. and Yvette Gordon reflecting a monthly rent of
$1800/month, beginning 2/l/06 urd ending 1/31/08; a copy ofa lease between 760 Liberty
Realty Corp. and Brian Miller dated l2l1l0'1, reflecting a monthly rent of $2,160, commencing
12/ 1 107 and ending 1 1/30/09.
During cross-examination and referring to the DHCR registrations, the witness admitted
that the three registrations contained conflicting information. The designations of the apartment
on each registration differed: "lR, *I STRIGHT" and "1RIGHT". He testified that these
designations refer to the subject premises.
REGISTRATION FOR IR
The registration for lR reflects no registration found from 1984 through 2005. In 2006,
the apartment is listed as rented to Yvette Gordon for the period of 2/112006 through 113112008
"Vac/Leas" for $ 1800.00/month. In 2007, the apartrnent is listed as rented to the same tenant for
the period of211/6 through ll3ll2008 "2nd Succ" for $ 1800/month. In 2008, the apartment is
listed as "HIGH RENT VACANCY" and "EXEMPT". There is no tenant listed as an occupant.

registration reflects this notation through 2024. Notably, the filing date for this registration is
12123115, or 8 years after the alleged occupancy of Yvette Gordon. The Court also notes that the
tenancy ofYvette Gordon predates petitioner's ownership by approximately l0 years.
REGISTRATION FOR IRIGHT
In 1984, the apartment listed as rented to Clara Quiles for $350.00/month. There is no
lease period indicated. From 1985 through 1989, no registration is found. In 1991, the apartment
is listed as rented to Margaret Holmes for the peiod of 212/90lhrough211192 "Vac/Leas
IMPRVMNT" for $650/month-legal rent registered is $728lmonth. In 1992, the apartment is
listed as rented to the same tenant for the period of 5/4191through 5/3/93 with the same legal and
preferential rent, ln 1993, the apartment is listed as rented to Timothy Norfleet for commencing
l2l9l95 "VACILEAS" for 600/month-legal rent registered is $786.24. The registration lists
tenants for the period of 1994 through 2003. In 2004, the apartment is listed as rented to Petro
Mora from 4/1/04 through 3/31/05 "VACILEAS" for the legal rent of $l I l8/month. In 2005, the
apartment is listed as rented to Anthony Perez for the period of3/1/05 through 2/28106
*VAC/LEAS INPRVMNT" for the legal rent of $ 1508.06/month. From 2006 through 2024, no
registration is found. The increase between the occupancy of Mora and Perez totals $390.00.
REGISTRATION FOR 1STRIGHT
In 1984, no registration is found. In 1985, the apartment is listed as rented to Clara Quiles
for $ 350/month commencing 9/30185. From 1986 through 1989 "LEAS/RNL", the apartment is
listed as rented to the same tenant with the legal rent of $372.75lmonth, $383.93/month and
$406.96/month. From 1990 lhrough 2024, no registration is found.
Furthermore, during cross-examination, the witness admitted on the registration for 1R,
his reference to Yvette Gordon being a second successor tenant was in error- "there was only

one person." In referring to the registration for lRight, he testified that improvements made in
2005 partly justified the $390 increase in the legal rent charged and testified that in the bathroom
he "changed the toilet, tub, hand-sink, ventilation." He also testified that he had installed new,
ceramic tile in the kitchen. The work was done by "Justin" who was the contractor he had hired.
When asked about invoices or cancelled checks, he testified that he did not have any ofthese
documents.
During re-direct, Mr. Lowton testified that he had witnessed the renovations and claimed
that he had "changed everything in the apartment, everything in the apartment was brand new."
Respondents called Mr. Lowton as their witness. He reiterated his claim of apartment
improvements related to an alleged "gut renovation" ofthe apartment. He testified that the work
was done two months before Anthony Perez moved into the apartment and a "whole bunch of
people were involved" and that it took "six-weeks to two months to complete the work." The
witness also admitted that in the registration for lRight, the periods ofoccupancy for Mora and
Perez overlap. He testified that this was an error.
A TENANT IS ABLE TO CHALLENGE THE DEREGULATED STATUS OF AN
APARTMENT AT ANY TIME DURING THE TENANCY
N.Y.C Admin. Code $ 26-516(9), which, during the applicable time, did not require rent
stabilized owners "to maintain or produce any records relating to rentals of such accommodation
for more than four years prior to the most recent registration or annual statement for such
accommodation." However, well before the passage of the HSTPA, they have been on notice of
the need to keep important documentation beyond the statutorily required minimums,
particularly where the documentation is necessary to show a change in the regulatory status ofan

AD3d 166, 167 [1st Dept 2005]. In Easl lL Renovating, the Supreme Court, Appellate Division,
First Department held in the owner's appeal of a rent overcharge complaint that DHCR's
"consideration ofevents beyond the four-year period is permissible ifdone not for the purpose of
calculating an overcharge but rather to determine whether an apartment is regulated." Id. at 167.
ln Gersten v 56 7th Ave. LLC, the First Dept. Appellate Division in 2011, held that "a
tenant should be able to challenge the deregulated status ofan apartment at any time during the
tenancy. Indeed, courts have uniformly held that landlords must prove the change in an
apartment's status from rent stabilized to unregulated even beyond the four-year statute of
limitations for rent overcharge claims." 88 AD3d I 89, 199 [1st Dept 2011], appeal withdrawn 18
NY3d 954 [2012]. The Gersten court noted that "imposing a [statute ofl limitations defense on
determining rent regulatory status subverts the protection afforded by the rent-stabilization
scheme, and except to limit rent overcharge claims, the Legislature has not imposed a limitations
period for determining the rent regulatory status ofan apartment." 1d.
Post HSTPA, the NYC Admin Code 26-5 l6 (g) relied on by petitioner increased the time
frame an owner had to keep documents from four to six years and also included the clarifuing
language, "[h]owever, an owner's election not to maintain records shall not limit the authority of
the division ofhousing and community renewal and the courts to examine the rental history and
determine legal regulated rents pursuant to this section." NYC Administrative Code 26-516 (g).

persuasive force of the evidence submitted by each prty." Jemrock Realty Co v Krugman,13
NY3d 924 (2010).
THE REOUIRED LEASE RIDER WAS NOT PROVIDED TO THE
FIRST DEREGULATED TENANT
The first tenant after the apartment is deregulated is entitled to notice. The first non-
regulated tenant must receive lease notices explaining how and why the apartment is no longer
rent stabilized. The Appellate Division in East West Renovating Co. v. N.Y DHCR, supra; and
Fuentes v. Kwik Realty LLC held that a tenant was entitled to a rent stabilized lease because the
owner failed to provide the rent stabilization rider. 186A.D.3d435:
Plaintiff, as the first rent stabilized tenant ofthe apartment, was entitled to the
notices required by Rent Stabilization Law of 1969 RSL $ 26-504.2(b) and RSC 9
NYCRR 5 2522.5 (c) (3). Defendant was required to give written notice to the
first tenant ofthe apartment after the apartment became exempt from rent
stabilization, indicating the last regulated rent, the reason that the apartment is no
longer subject to rent stabilization, and how the rent amount is computed (RSC $
2522.5 lcllll. Where an owner fails to provide the rent stabilization rider or
requested documentation, 'the owner shall not be entitled to collect any
adjustments in excess of the rent set forth in the prior lease unless the or+,ner can
establish that the rent collected was otherwise legal. RSC g 2522.5 [c][3].
APPLICATION OFTHE LAW
In the instant case, petitioner failed to satisfr both it its burden ofproofand
burden ofpersuasion which must be established based on the preponderance of the
evidence.

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 62 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 09/05/2025
Regarding its burden ofproof, petitioner failed to provide any documentation
tending to show that a "gut renovation" of the apartment occuned in 2006. The witness
could not proffer one invoice or receipt reflecting payment ofany amount. Similarly,
petitioner failed to proffer proofofa contract with the alleged contractor and/or a scope
of work related to the gut renovation. This Court was not provided any objective proof
that renovations were made to the subject premises in 2006.
Petitioner relies heavily on the DHCR registrations to buttress its claim of lawful
deregulation. However, the Court notes that registrations are filed by the landlord and not
vetted by the DHCR.
Moreover, the registrations were rife with errors, as petitioner's witness conceded.
First, the registrations contain differing designations of the subject premises. Second,
they provide different information for the same periods of time. For example, two
registrations reflect no registration for 1984 while another reflects Clara Quiles as a
tenant. Another registration indicates that Clara Quiles took occupancy in 1985 and not
1984. Third, the registration for lR reflects Yvette Gordon as a second successor tenant
for the same period she is listed as a new tenant with a vacancy lease. Fourth, on that
same registration, the subject premises are registered as "exempt" in 2008 based on high
rent vacancy while two other registrations reflect no registrations for that year. Notably,
the registration for lR indicates that the information for 2006 was based on a retroactive
filing in 2015. Finally, two ofthe registrations do not list the occupancy of Brian Miller
in 2007. Moreover, the lease with him was for the period of2007 through 2009 which
overlapped without credible explanation the occupancy of Yvette Gordon.

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 62 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 09/05/2025
Regarding the w tten leases, the defect is glaring in that they are between 760
Liberty Realty Corp. and various tenants. Yet, the petitioner herein is 756 Liberty Realty
LLC, and the witness did not offer any explanation for this discrepancy. In addition,
petitioner became owner of the building containing the subject premises in 2016, well
after the events that underlay this proceeding. The witness testified that he is the sole
owner ofthe petitioner but not ofthe corporation that is the signatory to the leases.
The Court finds that Brian Miller is the first non-rent stabilized tenant ofthe
subject apartment based on the December 1,2007, lease. On its first page, the document
states it is a "non rent stabilized residential lease". On the third and last page, the lease
also states, "[w]e understand that this apartment is non rent stabilized, and rent is not
regulated." Aside from these references, the required rent stabilization riders are not
appended to Mr. Miller's lease and is therefore another fatal oversight by petitioner in its
attempt to prove the deregulated status ofthe apartment.
The inconsistencies in the registrations and leases with the unexplained nine-year
gap in filing ofregistrations render this documentation wholly unreliable and insufhcient
to corroborate the witness' testimony regarding the rent regulation status of the building.
Finally, respondent's counsel contends that NYC Administrative Code 26-516(9)
relieves petitioner ofany obligation to retain after four years any documents related to the
existence and value ofthe renovations done in the subject premises. For counsel,
petitioner's witness'viva voce testimony is suffrcient, and they apparently believe it
would result in undue prejudice to require the proffer ofany documentary proof.
The fallacy ofthis argument is proven by the following: a landlord who has done
IAIs but has prooflike invoices and receipts that don't total the value necessary for high
10

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 62 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 09/05/2025
rent regulation will lose in court. However, a landlord that hasn't done any work but cites
the administrative code will prevail at trial by simply declaring that the work was done,
"take my word for it." Counsel's contention if adopted would most certainly encourage
deception and the ultimate improper deregulation of many rent stabilized apartments.
The Court rejects the legal conlention for obvious reasons. First, the express
language ofthe regulation does not refer to its impact on legal proceedings. Second, the
regulation existed concomitantly with the statutes and regulations mandating objective
proofoflAls before an apartment can be deemed exempt. Third, petitioner's contention
is belied by the caselaw recognizing the difference in application ofthe regulation to
proceedings involving the determination of the rent regulatory status of an apartment
versus and overcharge,
FinallS harkening back to the burden ofpersuasion, this Court was not convinced
that IAI's were completed in the subject premises. The witness talked in generalities,
confused dates and times, could not recall the complete name of the contractor, and
admitted that he was not always on site when the work was completed. His admission
that he made errors when back filing the registrations also undermined his reliability. This
Court did not find him credible, although not deceptive. He simply could not remember
the scope of work; the materials used and did not offer testimony as to whether the work
was actual improvements versus repair and replacement.
CONCLUSION
Under the circumstances, where the proofoflAl work is necessary even in part for
petitioner to reach the threshold for deregulation, the Court holds that petitioner has failed to
meet its prima facie burden. Therefore, the Court dismisses the petition with prejudice,
